	# Several changes have been done in this file:
	# - Some traffic parameters are moved to traffic_data.sii
	# - Scaling of most of the parameters is hardcoded, but you can still change these parameters 
	#	by means of the related parameters named ..._factor.
	#	For example, setting damping_scaling_front_factor = 2 increases former
	#	damping_scaling_front twice.
	#	This change will enable us to maintain compatibility between different versions,
	#	since our physics is being developed continuously and physics parameters are inevitably changing.
	# - Some parameters have become obsolete due to physics changes - these are removed.
	# - Some parameters are dangerous to change, since often you can achieve the same effect by more proper means,
	#	and that's why they are disabled and removed from this file.
	# Hopefully further physics improvements will make the physics robust enough to allow us to provide you even more
	# 	physics parameters to set up or to experiment with.
	# Don't forget, our ultimate goal is to provide you the best possible truck enthusiast's enjoyment!


	# Version of the structure used by the game to reduce some mod compatibility issues.
	#
	# Changes in individual versions:
	# 1 - The thrust_characteristic_viscosity is now scaled by engine torque. When
	#     loading older version, the old value is divided by 1875.
	# 2 - several parameters made relative to maintain compatibility

	version: 2

	# These coeficients are used for computing autocentering wheel speed.
	# The faster vehicle moves and the more steering wheel is turned left or right
	# the higher autocentering speed is.
	# Given value of speed_coef is for 100km/h velocity (linear raise).
	# Given value of angle_coef is for maximum wheel turn (30degrees, linear raise).
	# Returning speed coeficient is computed by multiplication of both coeficients.
	# When result coeficient is 1, returning speed is exactly the same as full
	# turning speed. This balance points define natural limits of steering
	# dependent on vehicle speed.
	# Ratio_coef defines upper limit of result coeficient (ratio against player).
