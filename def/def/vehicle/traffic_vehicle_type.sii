# For modders: Please do not modify this file if you want to add a new entry. Create in
# this directory a new file "<base_name>.<idofyourmod>.sii" where <base_name> is name of
# base file without the extension (e.g. "city" for "/def/city.sii") and <idofyourmod> is
# some string which is unlikely to conflict with other mod.
#
# Warning: Even if the units are specified in more than one source file, they share the
# same namespace so suffixes or prefixes should be used to avoid conflicts.
#
#
# NOTE: Default traffic vehicle storage path is '/def/vehicle/traffic_storage_(type).sii'
#
# For example, for vehicle type 'truck' the path will be:
# '/def/vehicle/traffic_storage_truck.sii'
#
# NOTE: The order of 3 basic vehicle type 'groups' (car*, truck*, bus*) is important.
# The first type of each group is considered 'default type' for that group (currently: car, truck, bus).
# These defaults are mainly used to keep backward compatibility with versions where the vehicle types were hardcoded
