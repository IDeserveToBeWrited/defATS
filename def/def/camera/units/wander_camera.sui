	# Every set describes location. All attributes must be present.
	# - area_center is point when camera starts, then camera walks randomly.
	
	# - area_radius defines allowed distance from center, if camera cross the distance its teleported back to center.
	#               negative value means that no distance is defined and camera is never teleported back.
	
	# - area_time defines how long (seconds) the camera will walk in given location before moving further.
	#               negative value means that no time is defined and camera will walk in location forever.
	
	# - area_ingame_time defines in-game time, which camera sets after teleport to area_center. Time format "HH MM"
	#
	# - area_weather defines weather (0 = nice, 1 = bad). Default value is 0 (nice).

	# - area_countries_data[]: "washington". "utah"  wc running path is restricted to selected country-state only. Camera jump to area center on country border
